# DSnP Fall, 2016
There are my homeworks of the course *data structure and programming*. Files I worked on for each homework are included in the corresponding directories. There are also homework descriptions in each directory.

fraig is the final project, and it can be viewed as the last homework of this course.

Noted that the files can't be compiled, since some files that I don't have to work on are not included, and that this repository is for demonstration purpose.
